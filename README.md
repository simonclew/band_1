Code Institute Band project website by Simon Clew
Introduction

I chose to create my own project outside of the brief. However I stayed within the specification of the project. I however add some extra functions in order to show the actual musician (a prospect) how a re-worked site may look. 
The Home page is designed to be as simple as possible There is actually no text other than the Jumbotron with the strapline. This is intentional, over 70% of users come to the current site from youtube, therefore cluttering up the page with volumes of text attempting to write good keywords is impractical for a musician of this type (Celtic Folk music) and a site at this stage of development.
The menu is a standard boostrap  menu with the collapsing function for mobile deployment. 

*ISSUE on the drop down menu for desktop I need to change the background color to make it more visible

The Audio Page has a selection of albums and offers the user chances to listen or purchase via Google Play. In the real world this would be extended to i-tunes and ability to purchase CD’s directly.

The Video Page offers 4 different videos of the musician, which have embedded links to Youtube.  
ISSUE* The code I used from embedrespoivly.com although working is messy and has a .embed contained in the html Using bootstrap code or youtube embed code did not give me the results I was after with more time I would invesitgate this for a more elegant soluton.
ISSUE *I have a known issue where between 982px and 835 px the videos do not wrap correctly.

 The Live Page has a selection of upcoming concerts and links to the venues for extra information.

Collaborations has a drop-down for a musical collaboration with another musician and information about the musicians collaboration with PRS guitars.

Finally, Workshops has information and dates on collaborative workshops  
*ISSUE I have noticed after submitting that I missed a closing tag which makes the text appear outside of its container.

The footer has links to Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Youtube. I used the Font Awesome iconography. I do not see the need to add text to the icons. The orinal code for the footer came from the resume project. I used the font awesome icons here and changed the position and size.
A subscribe to newsletter options also resides in the footer. This is not connected to anything currently, merely the bootstrap standard mail form.
coding style tests

The way columns wrap in bootstrap mean I needed to code the Audio page the way I have in order for the titles and info above and below the images to stay in place at different screen resolutions.
I used Google Chrome Inspector and dev tools to make changes to my CSS and paste those back into my c9 CSS.
I continually tested the site at different screen resolutions using Chrome dev tools to do so.
